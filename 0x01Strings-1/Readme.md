# Python String
> Python has a built-in string class named "str" with many useful features. String literals can be enclosed by either single or double, although single quotes are more commonly used.

## TASKS

### 1.Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
### 2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
### 3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, return the empty string instead.
### 4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
### 5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
### 6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
### 7. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substrings 'not' and 'poor' in a given string. If 'not' follows 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'.
### 8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one.
### 9. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.
### 10. Write a Python program to change a given string to a newly string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.
### 11. Write a Python program to remove characters that have odd index values in a given string.
### 12. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.
### 13. Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases.
### 14. Write a Python program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the distinct words in sorted form (alphanumerically).
### 15. Write a Python function to create an HTML string with tags around the word(s).
### 16. Write a Python function to insert a string in the middle of a string.
### 17. Write a Python function to get a string made of 4 copies of the last two characters of a specified string (length must be at least 2).
### 18. Write a Python function to get a string made of the first three characters of a specified string. If the length of the string is less than 3, return the original string.
### 19. Write a Python program to get the last part of a string before a specified character.
### 20. Write a Python function to reverse a string if its length is a multiple of 4.
### 21. Write a Python function to convert a given string to all uppercase if it contains at least 2 uppercase characters in the first 4 characters.
### 22.Write a Python program to sort a string lexicographically.
### 23. Write a Python program to remove a newline in Python.
### 24. Write a Python program to check whether a string starts with specified characters.
### 25. Write a Python program to create a Caesar encryption.
